# Functional Testing
Process of validating that the software conforms to its specifications and
correctly performs its required functions. This entails a series of feature
by feature validation of behavior using a wide range of normal and erroneous
input data.

## Functional testing divided in 3 categories:
### Build Verification Tests:
Build Verification Test (BVT), also known as Build Acceptance Test,
is a set of tests run on each new build of a software to verify that
the build is testable before the build is released into further testing.

### Smoke Testing:
A subset of test cases that are designed to broadly and minimally
test to confirm that changes in the code of a particular build
function as expected and do not break an entire build.

### Regression:
Process of retesting a build after bug fixes and code changes to
find any unexpected loss of functionality in the new code base.
