"""Description: Module for library gluster dir class and related functions

A GlusterDir is a file object that exists on the client and backend brick.
This module provides low-level functions and a GlusterDir class to maintain
state and manage properties of a file in both locations.

GlusterDir inherits from GlusterFile.
